Environment creation complete. You should now create the environment(s) to support this infrastructure:

$ cd environment
$ terraform init
$ terraform workspace select {netId}-dev || terraform workspace new {netId}-dev
$ terraform apply

Repeat the workspace and apply steps for additional environments (e.g., test) as needed
